# Do You Need a Lawyer for Trademark Registration?

## ⚠️ Important: Trademark vs Patent

**This is a TRADEMARK application, NOT a patent application.**

### Trademark vs Patent:
- **Trademark** = Brand name/logo protection (what you're doing)
  - Example: "MyTribal AI" name protection
  - Protects your brand identity
  - $49-$299+ depending on package

- **Patent** = Invention/process protection (different thing entirely)
  - Example: A new AI algorithm or technology
  - Much more complex and expensive ($5,000-$15,000+)
  - Completely different process

**Trademark lawyers specialize in trademarks, NOT patents.**
- Some IP lawyers do both, but they're separate services
- You'd need to specifically hire a patent lawyer for patents
- Patent applications are much more complex and expensive

## 🔍 About Patents:

**If you need patent help:**
- ❌ This service does NOT include patents
- ✅ You'd need a separate patent lawyer
- 💰 Cost: $5,000-$15,000+ for patents
- ⏱️ Time: 1-3 years for patent approval

**Do you need a patent?**
- Only if you've invented something new
- Not needed for brand names (that's trademark)
- Not needed for business ideas (that's trademark/service mark)

**For MyTribal AI:**
- ✅ Trademark = Protects "MyTribal AI" name ✅
- ❌ Patent = Not needed unless you invented new technology

## 💡 My Final Recommendation:

**For "MyTribal AI" trademark:**

**Go with Standard Package ($149)** ⭐

**Why:**
1. ✅ Includes 15-min lawyer consultation (worth it)
2. ✅ Professional review catches mistakes
3. ✅ Good balance of cost and protection
