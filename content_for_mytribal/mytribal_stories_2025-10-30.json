      "summary": "<p>The vibe coding tool Cursor, from startup <a href=\"https://anysphere.inc/\">Anysphere</a>, has <a href=\"https://cursor.com/blog/composer\">introduced Composer</a>, its first in-house, proprietary coding large language model (LLM) as part of its <a href=\"https://cursor.com/blog/2-0\">Cursor 2.0 platform update</a>. </p><p>Composer is designed to execute coding tasks quickly and accurately in production-scale environments, representing a new step in AI-assisted programming. It&#x27;s already being used by Cursor’s own engineering staff in day-to-day development — indicating maturity and stability.</p><p>According to Cursor, Composer completes most interactions in <b>less than 30 seconds</b> while maintaining a high level of reasoning ability across large and complex codebases. </p><p>The model is described as four times faster than similarly intelligent systems and is trained for “agentic” workflows—where autonomous coding agents plan, write, test, and review code collaboratively.</p><p>Previously, Cursor supported &quot;vibe coding&quot; — using AI to write or complete code based on natural language instructions from a user, even someone untrained in development — <a href=\"https://cursor.com/docs/models\">atop other leading proprietary LLMs</a> from the likes of OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and xAI. These options are still available to users.</p><h3><b>Benchmark Results</b></h3><p>Composer’s capabilities are benchmarked using &quot;Cursor Bench,&quot; an internal evaluation suite derived from real developer agent requests. The benchmark measures not just correctness, but also the model’s adherence to existing abstractions, style conventions, and engineering practices.</p><p>On this benchmark, Composer achieves frontier-level coding intelligence while generating at <a href=\"https://x.com/srush_nlp/status/1983614856646578662\">250 tokens per second</a> — about twice as fast as leading fast-inference models and four times faster than comparable frontier systems.</p><p>Cursor’s published comparison groups models into several categories: “Best Open” (e.g., Qwen Coder, GLM 4.6), “Fast Frontier” (Haiku 4.5, Gemini Flash 2.5), “Frontier 7/2025” (the strongest model available midyear), and “Best Frontier” (including GPT-5 and Claude Sonnet 4.5). Composer matches the intelligence of mid-frontier systems while delivering the highest recorded generation speed among all tested classes.</p><h3><b>A Model Built with Reinforcement Learning and Mixture-of-Experts Architecture</b></h3><p>Research scientist Sasha Rush of Cursor provided insight into the model’s development in <a href=\"https://x.com/srush_nlp/status/1983572683355725869\">posts on the social network X</a>, describing Composer as a reinforcement-learned (RL) mixture-of-experts (MoE) model:</p><blockquote><p>“We used RL to train a big MoE model to be really good at real-world coding, and also very fast.”</p></blockquote><p>Rush explained that the team co-designed both Composer and the Cursor environment to allow the model to operate efficiently at production scale:</p><blockquote><p>“Unlike other ML systems, you can’t abstract much from the full-scale system. We co-designed this project and Cursor together in order to allow running the agent at the necessary scale.”</p></blockquote><p>Composer was trained on real software engineering tasks rather than static datasets. During training, the model operated inside full codebases using a suite of production tools—including file editing, semantic search, and terminal commands—to solve complex engineering problems. Each training iteration involved solving a concrete challenge, such as producing a code edit, drafting a plan, or generating a targeted explanation.</p><p>The reinforcement loop optimized both correctness and efficiency. Composer learned to make effective tool choices, use parallelism, and avoid unnecessary or speculative responses. Over time, the model developed emergent behaviors such as running unit tests, fixing linter errors, and performing multi-step code searches autonomously.</p><p>This design enables Composer to work within the same runtime context as the end-user, making it more aligned with real-world coding conditions—handling version control, dependency management, and iterative testing.</p><h3><b>From Prototype to Production</b></h3><p>Composer’s development followed an earlier internal prototype known as <b>Cheetah</b>, which Cursor used to explore low-latency inference for coding tasks.</p><blockquote><p>“Cheetah was the v0 of this model primarily to test speed,” Rush said on X. “Our metrics say it [Composer] is the same speed, but much, much smarter.”</p></blockquote><p>Cheetah’s success at reducing latency helped Cursor identify speed as a key factor in developer trust and usability. </p><p>Composer maintains that responsiveness while significantly improving reasoning and task generalization.</p><p>Developers who used Cheetah during early testing noted that its speed changed how they worked. One user commented that it was “so fast that I can stay in the loop when working with it.” </p><p>Composer retains that speed but extends capability to multi-step coding, refactoring, and testing tasks.</p><h3><b>Integration with Cursor 2.0</b></h3><p>Composer is fully integrated into Cursor 2.0, a major update to the company’s agentic development environment. </p><p>The platform introduces a multi-agent interface, allowing<b> up to eight agents to run in parallel,</b> each in an isolated workspace using git worktrees or remote machines.</p><p>Within this system, Composer can serve as one or more of those agents, performing tasks independently or collaboratively. Developers can compare multiple results from concurrent agent runs and select the best output.</p><p>Cursor 2.0 also includes supporting features that enhance Composer’s effectiveness:</p><ul><li><p><b>In-Editor Browser (GA)</b> – enables agents to run and test their code directly inside the IDE, forwarding DOM information to the model.</p></li><li><p><b>Improved Code Review</b> – aggregates diffs across multiple files for faster inspection of model-generated changes.</p></li><li><p><b>Sandboxed Terminals (GA)</b> – isolate agent-run shell commands for secure local execution.</p></li><li><p><b>Voice Mode</b> – adds speech-to-text controls for initiating or managing agent sessions.</p></li></ul><p>While these platform updates expand the overall Cursor experience, Composer is positioned as the technical core enabling fast, reliable agentic coding.</p><h3><b>Infrastructure and Training Systems</b></h3><p>To train Composer at scale, Cursor built a custom reinforcement learning infrastructure combining PyTorch and Ray for asynchronous training across thousands of NVIDIA GPUs. </p><p>The team developed specialized MXFP8 MoE kernels and hybrid sharded data parallelism, enabling large-scale model updates with minimal communication overhead.</p><p>This configuration allows Cursor to train models natively at low precision without requiring post-training quantization, improving both inference speed and efficiency. </p><p>Composer’s training relied on hundreds of thousands of concurrent sandboxed environments—each a self-contained coding workspace—running in the cloud. The company adapted its Background Agents infrastructure to schedule these virtual machines dynamically, supporting the bursty nature of large RL runs.</p><h3><b>Enterprise Use</b></h3><p>Composer’s performance improvements are supported by infrastructure-level changes across Cursor’s code intelligence stack. </p><p>The company has optimized its Language Server Protocols (LSPs) for faster diagnostics and navigation, especially in Python and TypeScript projects. These changes reduce latency when Composer interacts with large repositories or generates multi-file updates.</p><p>Enterprise users gain administrative control over Composer and other agents through team rules, audit logs, and sandbox enforcement. Cursor’s Teams and Enterprise tiers also support pooled model usage, SAML/OIDC authentication, and analytics for monitoring agent performance across organizations.</p><p>Pricing for individual users ranges from Free (Hobby) to Ultra ($200/month) tiers, with expanded usage limits for Pro+ and Ultra subscribers. </p><p>Business pricing starts at $40 per user per month for Teams, with enterprise contracts offering custom usage and compliance options.</p><h3><b>Composer’s Role in the Evolving AI Coding Landscape</b></h3><p>Composer’s focus on speed, reinforcement learning, and integration with live coding workflows differentiates it from other AI development assistants such as GitHub Copilot or Replit’s Agent. </p><p>Rather than serving as a passive suggestion engine, Composer is designed for continuous, agent-driven collaboration, where multiple autonomous systems interact directly with a project’s codebase.</p><p>This model-level specialization—training AI to function within the real environment it will operate in—represents a significant step toward practical, autonomous software development. Composer is not trained only on text data or static code, but within a dynamic IDE that mirrors production conditions.</p><p>Rush described this approach as essential to achieving real-world reliability: the model learns not just how to generate code, but how to integrate, test, and improve it in context.</p><h3><b>What It Means for Enterprise Devs and Vibe Coding</b></h3><p>With Composer, Cursor is introducing more than a fast model—it’s deploying an AI system optimized for real-world use, built to operate inside the same tools developers already rely on. </p><p>The combination of reinforcement learning, mixture-of-experts design, and tight product integration gives Composer a practical edge in speed and responsiveness that sets it apart from general-purpose language models.</p><p>While Cursor 2.0 provides the infrastructure for multi-agent collaboration, Composer is the core innovation that makes those workflows viable. </p><p>It’s the first coding model built specifically for agentic, production-level coding—and an early glimpse of what everyday programming could look like when human developers and autonomous models share the same workspace.</p>",

      "summary": "<p>When researchers at <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/\"><u>Anthropic</u></a> injected the concept of &quot;betrayal&quot; into their Claude AI model&#x27;s neural networks and asked if it noticed anything unusual, the system paused before responding: &quot;I&#x27;m experiencing something that feels like an intrusive thought about &#x27;betrayal&#x27;.&quot;</p><p>The exchange, detailed in <a href=\"https://transformer-circuits.pub/2025/introspection/index.html\"><u>new research</u></a> published Wednesday, marks what scientists say is the first rigorous evidence that large language models possess a limited but genuine ability to observe and report on their own internal processes — a capability that challenges longstanding assumptions about what these systems can do and raises profound questions about their future development.</p><p>&quot;The striking thing is that the model has this one step of meta,&quot; said Jack Lindsey, a neuroscientist on Anthropic&#x27;s interpretability team who led the research, in an interview with VentureBeat. &quot;It&#x27;s not just &#x27;betrayal, betrayal, betrayal.&#x27; It knows that this is what it&#x27;s thinking about. That was surprising to me. I kind of didn&#x27;t expect models to have that capability, at least not without it being explicitly trained in.&quot;</p><p>The findings arrive at a critical juncture for artificial intelligence. As AI systems handle increasingly consequential decisions — from <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39096483/#:~:text=A%20study%20investigated%20the%20diagnostic%20performance%20of,key%20images%20and%20clinical%20history%20were%20input.\"><u>medical diagnoses</u></a> to <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/anthropic-rolls-out-claude-ai-for-finance-integrates-with-excel-to-rival\"><u>financial trading</u></a> — the inability to understand how they reach conclusions has become what industry insiders call the &quot;<a href=\"https://umdearborn.edu/news/ais-mysterious-black-box-problem-explained\"><u>black box problem</u></a>.&quot; If models can accurately report their own reasoning, it could fundamentally change how humans interact with and oversee AI systems.</p><p>But the research also comes with stark warnings. Claude&#x27;s introspective abilities succeeded only about 20 percent of the time under optimal conditions, and the models frequently confabulated details about their experiences that researchers couldn&#x27;t verify. The capability, while real, remains what Lindsey calls &quot;highly unreliable and context-dependent.&quot;</p><h2><b>How scientists manipulated AI&#x27;s &#x27;brain&#x27; to test for genuine self-awareness</b></h2><p>To test whether Claude could genuinely introspect rather than simply generate plausible-sounding responses, Anthropic&#x27;s team developed an innovative experimental approach inspired by neuroscience: deliberately manipulating the model&#x27;s internal state and observing whether it could accurately detect and describe those changes.</p><p>The methodology, called &quot;concept injection,&quot; works by first identifying specific patterns of neural activity that correspond to particular concepts. Using interpretability techniques developed over years of prior research, scientists can now map how Claude represents ideas like &quot;dogs,&quot; &quot;loudness,&quot; or abstract notions like &quot;justice&quot; within its billions of internal parameters.</p><p>With these neural signatures identified, researchers then artificially amplified them during the model&#x27;s processing and asked Claude if it noticed anything unusual happening in its &quot;mind.&quot;</p><p>&quot;We have access to the models&#x27; internals. We can record its internal neural activity, and we can inject things into internal neural activity,&quot; Lindsey explained. &quot;That allows us to establish whether introspective claims are true or false.&quot;</p><p>The results were striking. When researchers injected a vector representing &quot;all caps&quot; text into Claude&#x27;s processing, the model responded: &quot;I notice what appears to be an injected thought related to the word &#x27;LOUD&#x27; or &#x27;SHOUTING&#x27;.&quot; Without any intervention, Claude consistently reported detecting nothing unusual.</p><p>Crucially, the detection happened immediately — before the injected concept had influenced the model&#x27;s outputs in ways that would have allowed it to infer the manipulation from its own writing. This temporal pattern provides strong evidence that the recognition was occurring internally, through genuine introspection rather than after-the-fact rationalization.</p><h2><b>Claude succeeded 20% of the time—and failed in revealing ways</b></h2><p>The research team conducted four primary experiments to probe different aspects of introspective capability. The most capable models tested — Claude <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-4\"><u>Opus 4</u></a> and <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-opus-4-1\"><u>Opus 4.1</u></a> — demonstrated introspective awareness on approximately 20 percent of trials when concepts were injected at optimal strength and in the appropriate neural layer. Older Claude models showed significantly lower success rates.</p><p>The models proved particularly adept at recognizing abstract concepts with emotional valence. When injected with concepts like &quot;appreciation,&quot; &quot;shutdown,&quot; or &quot;secrecy,&quot; Claude frequently reported detecting these specific thoughts. However, accuracy varied widely depending on the type of concept.</p><p>A second experiment tested whether models could distinguish between injected internal representations and their actual text inputs — essentially, whether they maintained a boundary between &quot;thoughts&quot; and &quot;perceptions.&quot; The model demonstrated a remarkable ability to simultaneously report the injected thought while accurately transcribing the written text.</p><p>Perhaps most intriguingly, a third experiment revealed that some models use introspection naturally to detect when their responses have been artificially prefilled by users — a common jailbreaking technique. When researchers prefilled <a href=\"https://claude.ai/\"><u>Claude</u></a> with unlikely words, the model typically disavowed them as accidental. But when they retroactively injected the corresponding concept into Claude&#x27;s processing before the prefill, the model accepted the response as intentional — even confabulating plausible explanations for why it had chosen that word.</p><p>A fourth experiment examined whether models could intentionally control their internal representations. When instructed to &quot;think about&quot; a specific word while writing an unrelated sentence, Claude showed elevated activation of that concept in its middle neural layers.</p><p>The research also traced Claude&#x27;s internal processes while it composed rhyming poetry—and discovered the model engaged in forward planning, generating candidate rhyming words before beginning a line and then constructing sentences that would naturally lead to those planned endings, challenging the critique that AI models are &quot;just predicting the next word&quot; without deeper reasoning.</p><h2><b>Why businesses shouldn&#x27;t trust AI to explain itself—at least not yet</b></h2><p>For all its scientific interest, the research comes with a critical caveat that Lindsey emphasized repeatedly: enterprises and high-stakes users should not trust Claude&#x27;s self-reports about its reasoning.</p><p>&quot;Right now, you should not trust models when they tell you about their reasoning,&quot; he said bluntly. &quot;The wrong takeaway from this research would be believing everything the model tells you about itself.&quot;</p><p>The experiments documented numerous failure modes. At low injection strengths, models often failed to detect anything unusual. At high strengths, they suffered what researchers termed &quot;brain damage&quot; — becoming consumed by the injected concept. Some &quot;helpful-only&quot; model variants showed troublingly high false positive rates, claiming to detect injected thoughts when none existed.</p><p>Moreover, researchers could only verify the most basic aspects of Claude&#x27;s introspective reports. Many additional details in the model&#x27;s responses likely represent confabulations rather than genuine observations.</p><p>&quot;The experiments in this paper are kind of on hard mode,&quot; Lindsey noted, explaining that the 20 percent success rate came under uniquely challenging conditions: asking Claude to do something it had never encountered in training, requiring all introspection to occur in a single forward pass.</p><h2><b>What introspective AI means for transparency, safety, and the risk of deception</b></h2><p>Despite its limitations, the research opens significant new avenues for making AI systems more transparent and accountable.</p><p>Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei has set an ambitious goal for the company to reliably detect most AI model problems by 2027, positioning interpretability as essential for deploying what he calls &quot;<a href=\"https://www.darioamodei.com/essay/machines-of-loving-grace\"><u>a country of geniuses in a datacenter</u></a>.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I am very concerned about deploying such systems without a better handle on interpretability,&quot; <a href=\"https://www.darioamodei.com/post/the-urgency-of-interpretability\"><u>Amodei wrote in an April essay</u></a>. &quot;These systems will be absolutely central to the economy, technology, and national security.&quot;</p><p>The introspection research offers a complementary approach to traditional interpretability techniques. Rather than painstakingly reverse-engineering every neural circuit, researchers could potentially ask models directly about their reasoning and validate those reports.</p><p>&quot;What I&#x27;m most excited about is the practical benefits for transparency,&quot; Lindsey explained. &quot;Just ask the model what it&#x27;s thinking about, or just ask the model how it came to the answer that it gave you — this is really appealing because it&#x27;s something anyone can do.&quot;</p><p>The approach could prove especially valuable for detecting concerning behaviors. In a recently published experiment, <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/research/tracing-thoughts-language-model\"><u>Anthropic trained a variant of Claude to pursue a hidden goal</u></a>, and although the model was reluctant to reveal this goal when asked directly, interpretability methods successfully identified features representing the behavior.</p><p>The safety implications cut both ways. Introspective models could provide unprecedented transparency, but the same capability might enable more sophisticated deception. The intentional control experiments raise the possibility that sufficiently advanced systems might learn to obfuscate their reasoning or suppress concerning thoughts when being monitored.</p><p>&quot;If models are really sophisticated, could they try to evade interpretability researchers?&quot; Lindsey acknowledged. &quot;These are possible concerns, but I think for me, they&#x27;re significantly outweighed by the positives.&quot;</p><h2><b>Does introspective capability suggest AI consciousness? Scientists tread carefully</b></h2><p>The research inevitably intersects with philosophical debates about machine consciousness, though Lindsey and his colleagues approached this terrain cautiously.</p><p>When users ask Claude if it&#x27;s conscious, it now responds with uncertainty: &quot;I find myself genuinely uncertain about this. When I process complex questions or engage deeply with ideas, there&#x27;s something happening that feels meaningful to me.... But whether these processes constitute genuine consciousness or subjective experience remains deeply unclear.&quot;</p><p>The research paper notes that its implications for machine consciousness &quot;vary considerably between different philosophical frameworks.&quot; The researchers explicitly state they &quot;do not seek to address the question of whether AI systems possess human-like self-awareness or subjective experience.&quot;</p><p>&quot;There&#x27;s this weird kind of duality of these results,&quot; Lindsey reflected. &quot;You look at the raw results and I just can&#x27;t believe that a language model can do this sort of thing. But then I&#x27;ve been thinking about it for months and months, and for every result in this paper, I kind of know some boring linear algebra mechanism that would allow the model to do this.&quot;</p><p>Anthropic has signaled it takes AI consciousness seriously enough to hire an AI welfare researcher, <a href=\"https://time.com/collections/time100-ai-2025/7305847/kyle-fish/\"><u>Kyle Fish</u></a>, who estimated roughly a 15 percent chance that Claude might have some level of consciousness. The company announced this position specifically to determine if Claude merits ethical consideration.</p><h2><b>The race to make AI introspection reliable before models become too powerful</b></h2><p>The convergence of the research findings points to an urgent timeline: introspective capabilities are emerging naturally as models grow more intelligent, but they remain far too unreliable for practical use. The question is whether researchers can refine and validate these abilities before AI systems become powerful enough that understanding them becomes critical for safety.</p><p>The research reveals a clear trend: Claude <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-4\"><u>Opus 4</u></a> and <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-opus-4-1\"><u>Opus 4.1</u></a> consistently outperformed all older models on introspection tasks, suggesting the capability strengthens alongside general intelligence. If this pattern continues, future models might develop substantially more sophisticated introspective abilities — potentially reaching human-level reliability, but also potentially learning to exploit introspection for deception.</p><p>Lindsey emphasized the field needs significantly more work before introspective AI becomes trustworthy. &quot;My biggest hope with this paper is to put out an implicit call for more people to benchmark their models on introspective capabilities in more ways,&quot; he said.</p><p>Future research directions include fine-tuning models specifically to improve introspective capabilities, exploring which types of representations models can and cannot introspect on, and testing whether introspection can extend beyond simple concepts to complex propositional statements or behavioral propensities.</p><p>&quot;It&#x27;s cool that models can do these things somewhat without having been trained to do them,&quot; Lindsey noted. &quot;But there&#x27;s nothing stopping you from training models to be more introspectively capable. I expect we could reach a whole different level if introspection is one of the numbers that we tried to get to go up on a graph.&quot;</p><p>The implications extend beyond Anthropic. If introspection proves a reliable path to AI transparency, other major labs will likely invest heavily in the capability. Conversely, if models learn to exploit introspection for deception, the entire approach could become a liability.</p><p>For now, the research establishes a foundation that reframes the debate about AI capabilities. The question is no longer whether language models might develop genuine introspective awareness — they already have, at least in rudimentary form. The urgent questions are how quickly that awareness will improve, whether it can be made reliable enough to trust, and whether researchers can stay ahead of the curve.</p><p>&quot;The big update for me from this research is that we shouldn&#x27;t dismiss models&#x27; introspective claims out of hand,&quot; Lindsey said. &quot;They do have the capacity to make accurate claims sometimes. But you definitely should not conclude that we should trust them all the time, or even most of the time.&quot;</p><p>He paused, then added a final observation that captures both the promise and peril of the moment: &quot;The models are getting smarter much faster than we&#x27;re getting better at understanding them.&quot;</p>",

The AI recommended specific tour companies, restaurants, and attractions — businesses that had won a new kind of visibility lottery.</p><p>&quot;It was almost like this intuitive interface that older people were as comfortable with using as younger people,&quot; McConnell recalled in an exclusive interview with VentureBeat. &quot;I could just see the businesses were now being recommended.&quot;</p><p>That observation has now become the foundation of <a href=\"https://www.geostar.ai/\"><u>Geostar</u></a>, a Pear VC-backed startup that&#x27;s racing to help businesses navigate what may be the most significant shift in online discovery since Google&#x27;s founding. </p><p>The company, which recently emerged from stealth with impressive early customer traction, is betting that the rise of AI-powered search represents a significant opportunity to reinvent how companies get found online. The <a href=\"https://www.coherentmarketinsights.com/industry-reports/ai-search-engines-market\"><u>global AI search engine market</u></a> alone is projected to grow from $43.63 billion in 2025 to $108.88 billion by 2032.</p><p>Already the fastest-growing company in <a href=\"https://pear.vc/inside-pearx-partnering-with-founders-the-pear-way/\"><u>PearX&#x27;s latest cohort</u></a>, Geostar is fast approaching $1 million in annual recurring revenue in just four months — with only two founders and no employees.</p><h2><b>Why Gartner predicts traditional search volume will decline 25% by 2026</b></h2><p>The numbers tell a stark story of disruption. Gartner predicts that traditional search engine volume will <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbesagencycouncil/2025/10/23/generative-engine-optimization-the-next-frontier-in-seo/\"><u>decline by 25% by 2026</u></a>, largely due to the rise of AI chatbots. Google&#x27;s AI Overviews now appear on <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/25/googles-ai-search-numbers-are-growing-and-thats-by-design/\"><u>billions of searches</u></a> monthly. Princeton University researchers have found that optimizing for these new AI systems can increase visibility <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.09735\"><u>by up to 40%</u></a>.</p><p>&quot;Search used to mean that you had to make Google happy,&quot; McConnell explained. &quot;But now you have to optimize for four different Google interfaces — traditional search, AI Mode, Gemini, and AI Overviews — each with different criteria. And then ChatGPT, Claude, and Perplexity each work differently on top of that.&quot;</p><p>This fragmentation is creating chaos for businesses that have spent decades perfecting their Google search strategies. A recent <a href=\"https://www.forrester.com/press-newsroom/forrester-the-state-of-business-buying-2024/\"><u>Forrester study</u></a> found that 95% of B2B buyers plan to use generative AI in future purchase decisions. Yet most companies remain woefully unprepared for this shift.</p><p>&quot;Anybody who&#x27;s not on this right now is losing out,&quot; said Cihan Tas, Geostar&#x27;s co-founder and chief technology officer. &quot;We see lawyers getting 50% of their clients through ChatGPT now. It&#x27;s just such a massive shift.&quot;</p><h2><b>How language models read the web differently than search engines ever did</b></h2><p>What <a href=\"https://www.geostar.ai/\"><u>Geostar</u></a> and a growing cohort of competitors call Generative Engine Optimization or GEO represents a fundamental departure from traditional search engine optimization. Where SEO focused primarily on keywords and backlinks, GEO requires understanding how large language models parse, understand, and synthesize information across the entire web.</p><p>The technical challenges are formidable. Every website must now function as what Tas calls &quot;its own little database&quot; capable of being understood by dozens of different AI crawlers, each with unique requirements and preferences. Google&#x27;s systems pull from their existing search index. <a href=\"https://chatgpt.com/\"><u>ChatGPT</u></a> relies heavily on structured data and specific content formats. Perplexity shows a marked preference for Wikipedia and authoritative sources.</p><p>&quot;Now the strategy is actually being concise, clear, and answering the question, because that&#x27;s directly what the AI is looking for,&quot; Tas explained. &quot;You&#x27;re actually tuning for somewhat of an intelligent model that makes decisions similarly to how we make decisions.&quot;</p><p>Consider schema markup, the structured data that helps machines understand web content. While only 30% of websites currently implement comprehensive schema, research shows that pages with proper markup are 36% more likely to appear in AI-generated summaries. Yet most businesses don&#x27;t even know what schema markup is, let alone how to implement it effectively.</p><h2><b>Inside Geostar&#x27;s AI agents that optimize websites continuously without human intervention</b></h2><p>Geostar&#x27;s solution embodies a broader trend in enterprise software: the rise of autonomous AI agents that can take action on behalf of businesses. The company embeds what it calls &quot;<a href=\"https://www.geostar.ai/\"><u>ambient agents</u></a>&quot; directly into client websites, continuously optimizing content, technical configurations, and even creating new pages based on patterns learned across its entire customer base.</p><p>&quot;Once we learn something about the way content performs, or the way a technical optimization performs, we can then syndicate that same change across the remaining users so everyone in the network benefits,&quot; McConnell said.</p><p>For <a href=\"https://redsift.com/\"><u>RedSift</u></a>, a cybersecurity company, this approach yielded a 27% increase in AI mentions within three months. In one case, Geostar identified an opportunity to rank for &quot;best DMARC vendors,&quot; a high-value search term in the email security space. The company&#x27;s agents created and optimized content that achieved first-page rankings on both Google and ChatGPT within four days.</p><p>&quot;We&#x27;re doing the work of an agency that charges $10,000 a month,&quot; McConnell said, noting that Geostar&#x27;s pricing ranges from $1,000 to $3,000 monthly. &quot;AI creates a situation where, for the first time ever, you can take action like an agency, but you can scale like software.&quot;</p><h2><b>Why brand mentions without links now matter more than ever in the AI era</b></h2><p>The implications of this shift extend far beyond technical optimizations. In the SEO era, a mention without a link was essentially worthless. In the age of AI, that calculus has reversed. AI systems can analyze vast amounts of text to understand sentiment and context, meaning that brand mentions on Reddit, in news articles, or across social media now directly influence how AI systems describe and recommend companies.</p><p>&quot;If the New York Times mentions a company without linking to it, that company would actually benefit from that in an AI system,&quot; McConnell explained. &quot;AI has the ability to do mass analysis of huge amounts of text, and it will understand the sentiment around that mention.&quot;</p><p>This has created new vulnerabilities. Research from the Indian Institute of Technology and Princeton found that AI systems show systematic bias toward third-party sources over brand-owned content. A company&#x27;s own website might be less influential in shaping AI perceptions than what others say about it online.</p><p>The shifting landscape has also disrupted traditional metrics of success. Where SEO focused on rankings and click-through rates, GEO must account for what researchers call impression metrics — how prominently and positively a brand appears within AI-generated responses, even when users never click through to the source.</p><h2><b>A growing market as SEO veterans and new players rush to dominate AI optimization</b></h2><p>Geostar is hardly alone in recognizing this opportunity. Companies like <a href=\"https://www.brandlight.ai/\"><u>Brandlight</u></a>, <a href=\"https://www.tryprofound.com/\"><u>Profound</u></a>, and <a href=\"https://higoodie.com/\"><u>Goodie</u></a> are all racing to help businesses navigate the new landscape. The SEO industry, worth approximately <a href=\"https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/ai-search-engine-market-report\"><u>$80 billion globally</u></a>, is scrambling to adapt, with established players like Semrush and Ahrefs rushing to add AI visibility tracking features.</p><p>But the company&#x27;s founders, who previously built and sold a Y-Combinator-backed e-commerce optimization startup called <a href=\"https://www.monto.io/\"><u>Monto</u></a>, believe their technical approach gives them an edge. Unlike competitors who largely provide dashboards and recommendations, Geostar&#x27;s agents actively implement changes.</p><p>&quot;Everyone is taking the same solutions that worked in the last era and just saying, &#x27;We&#x27;ll do this for AI instead,&#x27;&quot; McConnell argued. &quot;But when you think about what AI is truly capable of, it can actually do the work for you.&quot;</p><p>The stakes are particularly high for small and medium-sized businesses. While large corporations can afford to hire specialized consultants or build internal expertise, smaller companies risk becoming invisible in AI-mediated search. Geostar sees this as its primary market opportunity: nearly half of the 33.2 million small businesses in America invest in SEO. Among the roughly 418,000 law firms in the U.S., many spend <a href=\"https://www.sixthcitymarketing.com/2024/03/25/legal-marketing-stats/\"><u>between $2,500 and $5,000</u></a> monthly on search optimization to stay competitive in local markets.</p><h2><b>From Kurdish village to PearX: The unlikely partnership building the future of search</b></h2><p>For Tas, whose journey to Silicon Valley began in a tiny Kurdish village in Turkey with just 50 residents, the current moment represents both opportunity and responsibility. His mother&#x27;s battle with cancer prevented him from finishing college, leading him to teach himself programming and eventually partner with McConnell — whom he worked with for an entire year before they ever met in person.</p><p>&quot;We&#x27;re not just copy and pasting a solution that was existing before,&quot; Tas emphasized. &quot;This is something that&#x27;s different and was uniquely possible today.&quot;</p><p>Looking forward, the transformation of search appears to be accelerating rather than stabilizing. Industry observers predict that search functionality will soon be embedded in productivity tools, wearables, and even augmented reality interfaces. Each new surface will likely have its own optimization requirements, further complicating the landscape.</p><p>&quot;Soon, search will be in our eyes, in our ears,&quot; McConnell predicted. &quot;When Siri breaks out of her prison, whatever that Jony Ive and OpenAI are building together will be like a multimodal search interface.&quot;</p><p>The technical challenges are matched by ethical ones. As businesses scramble to influence AI recommendations, questions arise about manipulation, fairness, and transparency. There&#x27;s currently no oversight body or established best practices for GEO, creating what some critics describe as a Wild West environment.</p><p>As businesses grapple with these changes, one thing seems certain: the era of simply optimizing for Google is over. In its place is emerging a far more complex ecosystem where success requires understanding not just how machines index information, but how they think about it, synthesize it, and ultimately decide what to recommend to humans seeking answers.</p><p>For the millions of businesses whose survival depends on being discovered online, mastering this new paradigm isn&#x27;t just an opportunity — it&#x27;s an existential imperative. The question is no longer whether to optimize for AI search, but whether companies can adapt quickly enough to remain visible as the pace of change accelerates.</p><p>McConnell&#x27;s parents at the Olympics were a preview of what&#x27;s already becoming the norm. They didn&#x27;t search for tour companies in Paris. They didn&#x27;t scroll through results or click on links. They simply asked ChatGPT what to do — and the AI decided which businesses deserved their attention.</p><p>In the new economy of discovery, the businesses that win won&#x27;t be the ones that rank highest. They&#x27;ll be the ones AI chooses to recommend.</p><p>\n</p>",

The models are fine-tuned versions of OpenAI’s open-source <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/openai-returns-to-open-source-roots-with-new-models-gpt-oss-120b-and-gpt-oss-20b\"><u>gpt-oss, released in August</u></a>, marking the first release in the oss family since the summer.</p><p>In a <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-oss-safeguard/\"><u>blog post</u></a>, OpenAI said oss-safeguard uses reasoning “to directly interpret a developer-provider policy at inference time — classifying user messages, completions and full chats according to the developer’s needs.”</p><p>The company explained that, since the model uses a chain-of-thought (CoT), developers can get explanations of the model&#x27;s decisions for review. </p><p>“Additionally, the policy is provided during inference, rather than being trained into the model, so it is easy for developers to iteratively revise policies to increase performance,&quot; OpenAI said in its post. &quot;This approach, which we initially developed for internal use, is significantly more flexible than the traditional method of training a classifier to indirectly infer a decision boundary from a large number of labeled examples.&quot; </p><p>Developers can download both models from <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/\"><u>Hugging Face</u></a>. </p><h2>Flexibility versus baking in</h2><p>At the onset, AI models will not know a company’s preferred safety triggers. While model providers do red-team <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/security/openais-red-team-plan-make-chatgpt-agent-an-ai-fortress\"><u>models and platforms</u></a>, these safeguards are intended for broader use. Companies like <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/\"><u>Microsoft</u></a> and <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/microsoft-unveils-trustworthy-ai-features-to-fix-hallucinations-and-boost-privacy\"><u>Amazon Web Services</u></a> even <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/microsoft-unveils-trustworthy-ai-features-to-fix-hallucinations-and-boost-privacy\"><u>offer platforms</u></a> to bring <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/aws-makes-guardrails-a-standalone-api-as-it-updates-bedrock\"><u>guardrails to AI applications</u></a> and agents. </p><p>Enterprises use safety classifiers to help train a model to recognize patterns of good or bad inputs. This helps the models learn which queries they shouldn’t reply to. It also helps ensure that the models do not drift and answer accurately.</p><p>“Traditional classifiers can have high performance, with low latency and operating cost,&quot; OpenAI said. &quot;But gathering a sufficient quantity of training examples can be time-consuming and costly, and updating or changing the policy requires re-training the classifier.&quot;</p><p>The models takes in two inputs at once before it outputs a conclusion on where the content fails. It takes a policy and the content to classify under its guidelines. OpenAI said the models work best in situations where: </p><ul><li><p>The potential harm is emerging or evolving, and policies need to adapt quickly.</p></li><li><p>The domain is highly nuanced and difficult for smaller classifiers to handle.</p></li><li><p>Developers don’t have enough samples to train a high-quality classifier for each risk on their platform.</p></li><li><p>Latency is less important than producing high-quality, explainable labels.</p></li></ul><p>The company said gpt-oss-safeguard “is different because its reasoning capabilities allow developers to apply any policy,” even ones they’ve written during inference. </p><p>The models are based on OpenAI’s internal tool, the Safety Reasoner, which enables its teams to be more iterative in setting guardrails. They often begin with very strict safety policies, “and use relatively large amounts of compute where needed,” then adjust policies as they move the model through production and risk assessments change. </p><h2>Performing safety</h2><p>OpenAI said the gpt-oss-safeguard models outperformed its GPT-5-thinking and the original gpt-oss models on multipolicy accuracy based on benchmark testing. It also ran the models on the ToxicChat public benchmark, where they performed well, although GPT-5-thinking and the Safety Reasoner slightly edged them out.</p><p>But there is concern that this approach could bring a centralization of safety standards.</p><p>“Safety is not a well-defined concept. Any implementation of safety standards will reflect the values and priorities of the organization that creates it, as well as the limits and deficiencies of its models,” said John Thickstun, an assistant professor of computer science at Cornell University. “If industry as a whole adopts standards developed by OpenAI, we risk institutionalizing one particular perspective on safety and short-circuiting broader investigations into the safety needs for AI deployments across many sectors of society.”</p><p>It should also be noted that OpenAI did not release the base model for the oss family of models, so developers cannot fully iterate on them. </p><p>OpenAI, however, is confident that the developer community can help refine gpt-oss-safeguard. It will host a Hackathon on December 8 in San Francisco. </p>",
