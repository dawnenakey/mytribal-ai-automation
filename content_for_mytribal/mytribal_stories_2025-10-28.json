      "title": "Intuit learned to build AI agents for finance the hard way: Trust lost in buckets, earned back in spoonfuls",
      "summary": "<p>Building AI for financial software requires a different playbook than consumer AI, and <a href=\"https://www.intuit.com/\"><u>Intuit&#x27;s</u></a> latest QuickBooks release provides an example.</p><p>The company has announced Intuit Intelligence, a system that orchestrates specialized AI agents across its QuickBooks platform to handle tasks including sales tax compliance and payroll processing. These new agents augment existing accounting and project management agents (which have also been updated) as well as a unified interface that lets users query data across QuickBooks, third-party systems and uploaded files using natural language. </p><p>The new development follow years of investment and improvement in Intuit&#x27;s<a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/inside-intuits-genos-update-why-prompt-optimization-and-intelligent-data-cognition-are-critical-to-enterprise-agentic-ai-success\"> <u>GenOS</u></a>, allowing the company to build AI capabilities that reduce<a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/how-intuit-built-custom-financial-llms-that-cut-latency-50-while-boosting\"> <u>latency and improve accuracy</u></a>.</p><p>But the real news isn&#x27;t what Intuit built — it&#x27;s how they built it and why their design decisions will make AI more usable. The company&#x27;s latest AI rollout represents an evolution built on hard-won lessons about what works and what doesn&#x27;t when deploying AI in financial contexts.</p><p>What the company learned is sobering: Even when its accounting agent improved transaction categorization accuracy by 20 percentage points on average, they still received complaints about errors.</p><p>&quot;The use cases that we&#x27;re trying to solve for customers include tax and finance; if you make a mistake in this world, you lose trust with customers in buckets and we only get it back in spoonfuls,&quot; Joe Preston, Intuit&#x27;s VP of product and design, told VentureBeat.</p><h2>The architecture of trust: Real data queries over generative responses</h2><p>Intuit&#x27;s technical strategy centers on a fundamental design decision. For financial queries and business intelligence, the system queries actual data, rather than generating responses through large language models (LLMs).</p><p>A<!-- -->lso critically important: That data isn&#x27;t all in one place. Intuit&#x27;s technical implementation allows QuickBooks to ingest data from multiple distinct sources: native Intuit data, OAuth-connected third-party systems like Square for payments and user-uploaded files such as spreadsheets containing vendor pricing lists or marketing campaign data. This creates a unified data layer that AI agents can query reliably.</p><p>&quot;We&#x27;re actually querying your real data,&quot; Preston explained. &quot;That&#x27;s very different than if you were to just copy, paste out a spreadsheet or a PDF and paste into ChatGPT.&quot;</p><p>This architectural choice means that the Intuit Intelligence system functions more as an orchestration layer. It&#x27;s a natural language interface to structured data operations. When a user asks about projected profitability or wants to run payroll, the system translates the natural language query into database operations against verified financial data.</p><p>This matters because Intuit&#x27;s internal research has uncovered widespread shadow AI usage. When surveyed, 25% of accountants using QuickBooks admitted they were already copying and pasting data into ChatGPT or Google Gemini for analysis.</p><p>Intuit&#x27;s approach treats AI as a query translation and orchestration mechanism, not a content generator. This reduces the hallucination risk that has plagued AI deployments in financial contexts.</p><h2>Explainability as a design requirement, not an afterthought</h2><p>Beyond the technical architecture, Intuit has made explainability a core user experience across its AI agents. This goes beyond simply providing correct answers: It means showing users the reasoning behind automated decisions.</p><p>When Intuit&#x27;s accounting agent categorizes a transaction, it doesn&#x27;t just display the result; it shows the reasoning. This isn&#x27;t marketing copy about explainable AI, it&#x27;s actual UI displaying data points and logic.</p><p>&quot;It&#x27;s about closing that trust loop and making sure customers understand the why,&quot; Alistair Simpson, Intuit&#x27;s VP of design, told VentureBeat.</p><p>This becomes particularly critical when you consider Intuit&#x27;s user research: While half of small businesses describe AI as helpful, nearly a quarter haven&#x27;t used AI at all. The explanation layer serves both populations: Building confidence for newcomers, while giving experienced users the context to verify accuracy.</p><p>The design also enforces human control at critical decision points. This approach extends beyond the interface. Intuit connects users directly with human experts, embedded in the same workflows, when automation reaches its limits or when users want validation.</p><h2>Navigating the transition from forms to conversations</h2><p>One of Intuit&#x27;s more interesting challenges involves managing a fundamental shift in user interfaces. Preston described it as having one foot in the past and one foot in the future.</p><p>&quot;This isn&#x27;t just Intuit, this is the market as a whole,&quot; said Preston. &quot;Today we still have a lot of customers filling out forms and going through tables full of data. We&#x27;re investing a lot into leaning in and questioning the ways that we do it across our products today, where you&#x27;re basically just filling out, form after form, or table after table, because we see where the world is headed, which is really a different form of interacting with these products.&quot;</p><p>This creates a product design challenge: How do you serve users who are comfortable with traditional interfaces while gradually introducing conversational and agentic capabilities?</p><p>Intuit&#x27;s approach has been to embed AI agents directly into existing workflows. This means not forcing users to adopt entirely new interaction patterns. The payments agent appears alongside invoicing workflows; the accounting agent enhances the existing reconciliation process rather than replacing it. This incremental approach lets users experience AI benefits without abandoning familiar processes.</p><h2>What enterprise AI builders can learn from Intuit&#x27;s approach</h2><p>Intuit&#x27;s experience deploying AI in financial contexts surfaces several principles that apply broadly to enterprise AI initiatives. </p><p><b>Architecture matters for trust: </b>In domains where accuracy is critical, consider whether you need content generation or data query translation. Intuit&#x27;s decision to treat AI as an orchestration and natural language interface layer dramatically reduces hallucination risk and avoids using AI as a generative system.</p><p><b>Explainability must be designed in, not bolted on: </b>Showing users why the AI made a decision isn&#x27;t optional when trust is at stake. This requires deliberate UX design. It may constrain model choices.</p><p><b>User control preserves trust during accuracy improvements: </b>Intuit&#x27;s accounting agent improved categorization accuracy by 20 percentage points. Yet, maintaining user override capabilities was essential for adoption.</p><p><b>Transition gradually from familiar interfaces: </b>Don&#x27;t force users to abandon forms for conversations. Embed AI capabilities into existing workflows first. Let users experience benefits before asking them to change behavior.</p><p><b>Be honest about what&#x27;s reactive versus proactive: </b>Current AI agents primarily respond to prompts and automate defined tasks. True proactive intelligence that makes unprompted strategic recommendations remains an evolving capability. </p><p><b>Address workforce concerns with tooling, not just messaging: </b>If AI is meant to augment rather than replace workers, provide workers with AI tools. Show them how to leverage the technology.</p><p>For enterprises navigating AI adoption, Intuit&#x27;s journey offers a clear directive. The winning approach prioritizes trustworthiness over capability demonstrations. In domains where mistakes have real consequences, that means investing in accuracy, transparency and human oversight before pursuing conversational sophistication or autonomous action.</p><p>Simpson frames the challenge succinctly: &quot;We didn&#x27;t want it to be a bolted-on layer. We wanted customers to be in their natural workflow, and have agents doing work for customers, embedded in the workflow.&quot;</p>",

      "summary": "<p>Watch out, DeepSeek and Qwen! There&#x27;s a new king of open source large language models (LLMs), especially when it comes to something enterprises are increasingly valuing: agentic tool use — that is, the ability to go off and use other software capabilities like web search or bespoke applications — without much human guidance. </p><p>That model is none other than <a href=\"https://x.com/MiniMax__AI/status/1982674798649160175\"><b>MiniMax-M2</b></a>, the latest LLM from the Chinese startup of the same name. And in a big win for enterprises globally, the model is available under a permissive, enterprise-friendly MIT License, meaning it is made available freely for developers to take, deploy, retrain, and use how they see fit — even for commercial purposes. It can be found on <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/MiniMaxAI/MiniMax-M2\">Hugging Face</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/MiniMax-AI/MiniMax-M2\">GitHub</a> and <a href=\"https://www.modelscope.cn/models/MiniMax/MiniMax-M2\">ModelScope</a>, as well as through<a href=\"https://platform.minimax.io/docs/guides/text-generation\"> MiniMax&#x27;s API here.</a> It supports OpenAI and Anthropic API standards, as well, making it easy for customers of said proprietary AI startups to shift out their models to MiniMax&#x27;s API, if they want.</p><p>According to <a href=\"https://x.com/ArtificialAnlys/status/1982714153375854998\">independent evaluations by Artificial Analysis</a>, a third-party generative AI model benchmarking and research organization, M2 now ranks first among all open-weight systems worldwide on the Intelligence Index—a composite measure of reasoning, coding, and task-execution performance. </p><p>In agentic benchmarks that measure how well a model can plan, execute, and use external tools—skills that power coding assistants and autonomous agents—MiniMax’s own reported results, following the Artificial Analysis methodology, show τ²-Bench 77.2, BrowseComp 44.0, and FinSearchComp-global 65.5. </p><p>These scores place it at or near the level of top proprietary systems like GPT-5 (thinking) and Claude Sonnet 4.5, making <b>MiniMax-M2 the highest-performing open model yet released for real-world agentic and tool-calling tasks.</b></p><h3><b>What It Means For Enterprises and the AI Race</b></h3><p>Built around an efficient Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, MiniMax-M2 delivers high-end capability for agentic and developer workflows while remaining practical for enterprise deployment.</p><p>For technical decision-makers, the release marks an important turning point for open models in business settings. MiniMax-M2 combines frontier-level reasoning with a manageable activation footprint—just 10 billion active parameters out of 230 billion total. </p><p>This design enables enterprises to operate advanced reasoning and automation workloads on fewer GPUs, achieving near-state-of-the-art results without the infrastructure demands or licensing costs associated with proprietary frontier systems.</p><p>Artificial Analysis’ data show that MiniMax-M2’s strengths go beyond raw intelligence scores. The model leads or closely trails top proprietary systems such as GPT-5 (thinking) and Claude Sonnet 4.5 across benchmarks for end-to-end coding, reasoning, and agentic tool use. </p><p>Its performance in τ²-Bench, SWE-Bench, and BrowseComp indicates particular advantages for organizations that depend on AI systems capable of planning, executing, and verifying complex workflows—key functions for agentic and developer tools inside enterprise environments.</p><p>As LLM engineer Pierre-Carl Langlais aka <a href=\"https://x.com/Dorialexander/status/1982761110228127954\">Alexander Doria posted on X</a>: &quot;MiniMax [is] making a case for mastering the technology end-to-end to get actual agentic automation.&quot;</p><h3><b>Compact Design, Scalable Performance</b></h3><p>MiniMax-M2’s technical architecture is a sparse Mixture-of-Experts model with 230 billion total parameters and 10 billion active per inference. </p><p>This configuration significantly reduces latency and compute requirements while maintaining broad general intelligence. </p><p>The design allows for responsive agent loops—compile–run–test or browse–retrieve–cite cycles—that execute faster and more predictably than denser models.</p><p>For enterprise technology teams, this means easier scaling, lower cloud costs, and reduced deployment friction.<b> </b>According to Artificial Analysis, <b>the model can be served efficiently on as few as four NVIDIA H100 GPUs at FP8 precision</b>, a setup well within reach for mid-size organizations or departmental AI clusters.</p><h3><b>Benchmark Leadership Across Agentic and Coding Workflows</b></h3><p>MiniMax’s benchmark suite highlights strong real-world performance across developer and agent environments.

VentureBeat described how the model’s launch sparked widespread interest after online creators began sharing lifelike, AI-generated footage—most memorably, a viral clip of a <i>Star Wars</i> lightsaber duel that drew millions of views in under two days. </p><p>CEO Yan Junjie emphasized that the system outperformed leading Western tools in generating human movement and expression, an area where video AIs often struggle. The product, later commercialized through MiniMax’s <i>Hailuo</i> platform, showcased the startup’s technical confidence and creative reach, helping to establish China as a serious contender in generative video technology.</p><p>By early 2025, MiniMax had turned its attention to long-context language modeling, unveiling the <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/minimax-unveils-its-own-open-source-llm-with-industry-leading-4m-token-context\">MiniMax-01 series, including MiniMax-Text-01 and MiniMax-VL-01</a>. These open-weight models introduced an unprecedented 4-million-token context window, doubling the reach of Google’s Gemini 1.5 Pro and dwarfing OpenAI’s GPT-4o by more than twentyfold. </p><p>The company continued its rapid cadence with the <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/minimax-m1-is-a-new-open-source-model-with-1-million-token-context-and-new-hyper-efficient-reinforcement-learning\">MiniMax-M1 release in June 2025</a>, a model focused on long-context reasoning and reinforcement learning efficiency. M1 extended context capacity to 1 million tokens and introduced a hybrid Mixture-of-Experts design trained using a custom reinforcement-learning algorithm known as CISPO. Remarkably, VentureBeat reported that MiniMax trained M1 at a total cost of about $534,700, roughly one-tenth of DeepSeek’s R1 and far below the multimillion-dollar budgets typical for frontier-scale models. </p><p>For enterprises and technical teams, MiniMax’s trajectory signals the arrival of a new generation of cost-efficient, open-weight models designed for real-world deployment. Its open licensing—ranging from Apache 2.0 to MIT—gives businesses freedom to customize, self-host, and fine-tune without vendor lock-in or compliance restrictions. </p><p>Features such as structured function calling, long-context retention, and high-efficiency attention architectures directly address the needs of engineering groups managing multi-step reasoning systems and data-intensive pipelines.</p><p>As MiniMax continues to expand its lineup, the company has emerged as a key global innovator in open-weight AI, combining ambitious research with pragmatic engineering. </p><h3><b>Open-Weight Leadership and Industry Context</b></h3><p>The release of MiniMax-M2 reinforces the growing leadership of Chinese AI research groups in open-weight model development. </p><p>Following earlier contributions from DeepSeek, Alibaba’s Qwen series, and Moonshot AI, MiniMax’s entry continues the trend toward open, efficient systems designed for real-world use. </p><p>Artificial Analysis observed that MiniMax-M2 exemplifies a broader shift in focus toward agentic capability and reinforcement-learning refinement, prioritizing controllable reasoning and real utility over raw model size.</p><p>For enterprises, this means access to a state-of-the-art open model that can be audited, fine-tuned, and deployed internally with full transparency. </p><p>By pairing strong benchmark performance with open licensing and efficient scaling, MiniMaxAI positions MiniMax-M2 as a practical foundation for intelligent systems that think, act, and assist with traceable logic—making it one of the most enterprise-ready open AI models available today.</p>",
