      "summary": "<p>In a striking act of self-critique, one of the architects of the transformer technology that powers <a href=\"https://chatgpt.com/\"><u>ChatGPT</u></a>, <a href=\"https://claude.ai/\"><u>Claude</u></a>, and virtually every major AI system told an audience of industry leaders this week that artificial intelligence research has become dangerously narrow — and that he&#x27;s moving on from his own creation.</p><p><a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_3_P5VwAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\"><u>Llion Jones</u></a>, who co-authored the seminal 2017 paper &quot;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762\"><u>Attention Is All You Need</u></a>&quot; and even coined the name &quot;transformer,&quot; delivered an unusually candid assessment at the <a href=\"https://tedai-sanfrancisco.ted.com/\"><u>TED AI conference</u></a> in San Francisco on Tuesday: Despite <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2025/10/is-ai-a-boom-or-a-bubble\"><u>unprecedented investment</u></a> and talent flooding into AI, the field has calcified around a single architectural approach, potentially blinding researchers to the next major breakthrough.</p><p>&quot;Despite the fact that there&#x27;s never been so much interest and resources and money and talent, this has somehow caused the narrowing of the research that we&#x27;re doing,&quot; Jones told the audience. The culprit, he argued, is the &quot;immense amount of pressure&quot; from investors demanding returns and researchers scrambling to stand out in an overcrowded field.</p><p>The warning carries particular weight given Jones&#x27;s role in AI history. The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_(deep_learning_architecture)\"><u>transformer architecture</u></a> he helped develop at Google has become the foundation of the generative AI boom, enabling systems that can write essays, generate images, and engage in human-like conversation. His paper has been <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_3_P5VwAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\"><u>cited more than 100,000 times</u></a>, making it one of the most influential computer science publications of the century.</p><p>Now, as CTO and co-founder of Tokyo-based <a href=\"https://sakana.ai/\"><u>Sakana AI</u></a>, Jones is explicitly abandoning his own creation. &quot;I personally made a decision in the beginning of this year that I&#x27;m going to drastically reduce the amount of time that I spend on transformers,&quot; he said. &quot;I&#x27;m explicitly now exploring and looking for the next big thing.&quot;</p><h2><b>Why more AI funding has led to less creative research, according to a transformer pioneer</b></h2><p>Jones painted a picture of an AI research community suffering from what he called a paradox: More resources have led to less creativity. He described researchers constantly checking whether they&#x27;ve been &quot;scooped&quot; by competitors working on identical ideas, and academics choosing safe, publishable projects over risky, potentially transformative ones.</p><p>&quot;If you&#x27;re doing standard AI research right now, you kind of have to assume that there&#x27;s maybe three or four other groups doing something very similar, or maybe exactly the same,&quot; Jones said, describing an environment where &quot;unfortunately, this pressure damages the science, because people are rushing their papers, and it&#x27;s reducing the amount of creativity.&quot;</p><p>He drew an analogy from AI itself — the &quot;exploration versus exploitation&quot; trade-off that governs how algorithms search for solutions. When a system exploits too much and explores too little, it finds mediocre local solutions while missing superior alternatives. &quot;We are almost certainly in that situation right now in the AI industry,&quot; Jones argued.</p><p>The implications are sobering. Jones recalled the period just before transformers emerged, when researchers were endlessly tweaking recurrent neural networks — the previous dominant architecture — for incremental gains. Once transformers arrived, all that work suddenly seemed irrelevant. &quot;How much time do you think those researchers would have spent trying to improve the recurrent neural network if they knew something like transformers was around the corner?&quot; he asked.</p><p>He worries the field is repeating that pattern. &quot;I&#x27;m worried that we&#x27;re in that situation right now where we&#x27;re just concentrating on one architecture and just permuting it and trying different things, where there might be a breakthrough just around the corner.&quot;</p><h2><b>How the &#x27;Attention is all you need&#x27; paper was born from freedom, not pressure</b></h2><p>To underscore his point, Jones described the conditions that allowed transformers to emerge in the first place — a stark contrast to today&#x27;s environment. The project, he said, was &quot;very organic, bottom up,&quot; born from &quot;talking over lunch or scrawling randomly on the whiteboard in the office.&quot;</p><p>Critically, &quot;we didn&#x27;t actually have a good idea, we had the freedom to actually spend time and go and work on it, and even more importantly, we didn&#x27;t have any pressure that was coming down from management,&quot; Jones recounted. &quot;No pressure to work on any particular project, publish a number of papers to push a certain metric up.&quot;</p><p>That freedom, Jones suggested, is largely absent today. Even researchers recruited for astronomical salaries — &quot;literally a million dollars a year, in some cases&quot; — may not feel empowered to take risks. &quot;Do you think that when they start their new position they feel empowered to try their wild ideas and more speculative ideas, or do they feel immense pressure to prove their worth and once again, go for the low hanging fruit?&quot; he asked.</p><h2><b>Why one AI lab is betting that research freedom beats million-dollar salaries</b></h2><p>Jones&#x27;s proposed solution is deliberately provocative: Turn up the &quot;explore dial&quot; and openly share findings, even at competitive cost. He acknowledged the irony of his position. &quot;It may sound a little controversial to hear one of the Transformers authors stand on stage and tell you that he&#x27;s absolutely sick of them, but it&#x27;s kind of fair enough, right? I&#x27;ve been working on them longer than anyone, with the possible exception of seven people.&quot;</p><p>At <a href=\"https://sakana.ai/\"><u>Sakana AI</u></a>, Jones said he&#x27;s attempting to recreate that pre-transformer environment, with nature-inspired research and minimal pressure to chase publications or compete directly with rivals. He offered researchers a mantra from engineer Brian Cheung: &quot;You should only do the research that wouldn&#x27;t happen if you weren&#x27;t doing it.&quot;</p><p>One example is Sakana&#x27;s &quot;<a href=\"https://sakana.ai/ctm/\"><u>continuous thought machine</u></a>,&quot; which incorporates brain-like synchronization into neural networks. An employee who pitched the idea told Jones he would have faced skepticism and pressure not to waste time at previous employers or academic positions. At Sakana, Jones gave him a week to explore. The project became successful enough to be spotlighted at <a href=\"https://neurips.cc/virtual/2025/poster/115192\"><u>NeurIPS</u></a>, a major AI conference.</p><p>Jones even suggested that freedom beats compensation in recruiting. &quot;It&#x27;s a really, really good way of getting talent,&quot; he said of the exploratory environment. &quot;Think about it, talented, intelligent people, ambitious people, will naturally seek out this kind of environment.&quot;</p><h2><b>The transformer&#x27;s success may be blocking AI&#x27;s next breakthrough</b></h2><p>Perhaps most provocatively, Jones suggested transformers may be victims of their own success. &quot;The fact that the current technology is so powerful and flexible... stopped us from looking for better,&quot; he said. &quot;It makes sense that if the current technology was worse, more people would be looking for better.&quot;</p><p>He was careful to clarify that he&#x27;s not dismissing ongoing transformer research. &quot;There&#x27;s still plenty of very important work to be done on current technology and bringing a lot of value in the coming years,&quot; he said. &quot;I&#x27;m just saying that given the amount of talent and resources that we have currently, we can afford to do a lot more.&quot;</p><p>His ultimate message was one of collaboration over competition. &quot;Genuinely, from my perspective, this is not a competition,&quot; Jones concluded. &quot;We all have the same goal. We all want to see this technology progress so that we can all benefit from it. So if we can all collectively turn up the explore dial and then openly share what we find, we can get to our goal much faster.&quot;</p><h2><b>The high stakes of AI&#x27;s exploration problem</b></h2><p>The remarks arrive at a pivotal moment for artificial intelligence. The industry grapples with mounting evidence that simply building larger transformer models <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/the-ai-industrys-scaling-obsession-is-headed-for-a-cliff/\"><u>may be approaching diminishing returns</u></a>. Leading researchers have begun openly discussing whether the current paradigm has fundamental limitations, with some suggesting that architectural innovations — not just scale — will be needed for continued progress toward more capable AI systems.</p><p>Jones&#x27;s warning suggests that finding those innovations may require dismantling the very incentive structures that have driven AI&#x27;s recent boom. With <a href=\"https://hai.stanford.edu/ai-index/2025-ai-index-report/economy\"><u>tens of billions of dollars flowing into AI development annually</u></a> and fierce competition among labs driving secrecy and rapid publication cycles, the exploratory research environment he described seems increasingly distant.</p><p>Yet his insider perspective carries unusual weight. As someone who helped create the technology now dominating the field, Jones understands both what it takes to achieve breakthrough innovation and what the industry risks by abandoning that approach. His decision to walk away from transformers — the architecture that made his reputation — adds credibility to a message that might otherwise sound like contrarian positioning.</p><p>Whether AI&#x27;s power players will heed the call remains uncertain. But Jones offered a pointed reminder of what&#x27;s at stake: The next transformer-scale breakthrough could be just around the corner, pursued by researchers with the freedom to explore. Or it could be languishing unexplored while thousands of researchers race to publish incremental improvements on architecture that, in Jones&#x27;s words, one of its creators is &quot;absolutely sick of.&quot;</p><p>After all, he&#x27;s been working on transformers longer than almost anyone. He would know when it&#x27;s time to move on.</p>",

      "title": "Kai-Fu Lee's brutal assessment: America is already losing the AI hardware war to China",
      "summary": "<p>China is on track to dominate consumer artificial intelligence applications and robotics manufacturing within years, but the United States will maintain its substantial lead in enterprise AI adoption and cutting-edge research, according to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kai-Fu_Lee\"><u>Kai-Fu Lee</u></a>, one of the world&#x27;s most prominent AI scientists and investors.</p><p>In a rare, unvarnished assessment delivered via video link from Beijing to the <a href=\"https://tedai-sanfrancisco.ted.com/\"><u>TED AI conference</u></a> in San Francisco Tuesday, Lee — a former executive at Apple, Microsoft, and Google who now runs both a major venture capital firm and his own AI company — laid out a technology landscape splitting along geographic and economic lines, with profound implications for both commercial competition and national security.</p><p>&quot;China&#x27;s robotics has the advantage of having integrated AI into much lower costs, better supply chain and fast turnaround, so companies like <a href=\"https://www.unitree.com/\"><u>Unitree</u></a> are actually the farthest ahead in the world in terms of building affordable, embodied humanoid AI,&quot; Lee said, referring to a Chinese robotics manufacturer that has undercut Western competitors on price while advancing capabilities.</p><p>The comments, made to a room filled with Silicon Valley executives, investors, and researchers, represented one of the most detailed public assessments from Lee about the comparative strengths and weaknesses of the world&#x27;s two AI superpowers — and suggested that the race for artificial intelligence leadership is becoming less a single contest than a series of parallel competitions with different winners.</p><h2><b>Why venture capital is flowing in opposite directions in the U.S. and China</b></h2><p>At the heart of Lee&#x27;s analysis lies a fundamental difference in how capital flows in the two countries&#x27; innovation ecosystems. American venture capitalists, Lee said, are pouring money into generative AI companies building large language models and enterprise software, while Chinese investors are betting heavily on robotics and hardware.</p><p>&quot;The VCs in the US don&#x27;t fund robotics the way the VCs do in China,&quot; Lee said. &quot;Just like the VCs in China don&#x27;t fund generative AI the way the VCs do in the US.&quot;</p><p>This investment divergence reflects different economic incentives and market structures. In the United States, where companies have grown accustomed to paying for software subscriptions and where labor costs are high, enterprise AI tools that boost white-collar productivity command premium prices. In China, where software subscription models have historically struggled to gain traction but manufacturing dominates the economy, robotics offers a clearer path to commercialization.</p><p>The result, Lee suggested, is that each country is pulling ahead in different domains — and may continue to do so.</p><p>&quot;China&#x27;s got some challenges to overcome in getting a company funded as well as OpenAI or Anthropic,&quot; Lee acknowledged, referring to the leading American AI labs. &quot;But I think U.S., on the flip side, will have trouble developing the investment interest and value creation in the robotics&quot; sector.</p><h2><b>Why American companies dominate enterprise AI while Chinese firms struggle with subscriptions</b></h2><p>Lee was explicit about one area where the United States maintains what appears to be a durable advantage: getting businesses to actually adopt and pay for AI software.</p><p>&quot;The enterprise adoption will clearly be led by the United States,&quot; Lee said. &quot;The Chinese companies have not yet developed a habit of paying for software on a subscription.&quot;</p><p>This seemingly mundane difference in business culture — whether companies will pay monthly fees for software — has become a critical factor in the AI race. The explosion of spending on tools like <a href=\"https://github.com/features/copilot\"><u>GitHub Copilot</u></a>, <a href=\"https://chatgpt.com/business/enterprise?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=paidsearch_brand&amp;utm_campaign=GOOG_B_SEM_GBR_Core_ENT_BAU_ACQ_PER_BRD_ALL_NAMER_US_EN_080625&amp;utm_term=chatgpt%20enterprise&amp;utm_content=182507886919&amp;utm_ad=779434575256&amp;utm_match=b&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=22855802308&amp;gbraid=0AAAAA-I0E5deWS9iAj-S2JPixEaUT67Un&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwgeLHBhBuEiwAL5gNEQgjDKgZm5up9BDA-oZ1HLMAECMm5XlfJerkJ9BbJgtkYf9GcAAQUhoCrskQAvD_BwE\"><u>ChatGPT Enterprise</u></a>, and other AI-powered productivity software has fueled American companies&#x27; ability to invest billions in further research and development.</p><p>Lee noted that China has historically overcome similar challenges in consumer technology by developing alternative business models. &quot;In the early days of internet software, China was also well behind because people weren&#x27;t willing to pay for software,&quot; he said. &quot;But then advertising models, e-commerce models really propelled China forward.&quot;</p><p>Still, he suggested, someone will need to &quot;find a new business model that isn&#x27;t just pay per software per use or per month basis. That&#x27;s going to not happen in China anytime soon.&quot;</p><p>The implication: American companies building enterprise AI tools have a window — perhaps a substantial one — where they can generate revenue and reinvest in R&amp;D without facing serious Chinese competition in their core market.</p><h2><b>How ByteDance, Alibaba and Tencent will outpace Meta and Google in consumer AI</b></h2><p>Where Lee sees China pulling ahead decisively is in consumer-facing AI applications — the kind embedded in social media, e-commerce, and entertainment platforms that billions of people use daily.</p><p>&quot;In terms of consumer usage, that&#x27;s likely to happen,&quot; Lee said, referring to China matching or surpassing the United States in AI deployment. &quot;The Chinese giants, like <a href=\"https://www.bytedance.com/en/\"><u>ByteDance</u></a> and <a href=\"https://www.alibaba.com/\"><u>Alibaba</u></a> and <a href=\"https://www.tencent.com/\"><u>Tencent</u></a>, will definitely move a lot faster than their equivalent in the United States, companies like <a href=\"https://www.meta.com/\"><u>Meta</u></a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/\"><u>YouTube</u></a> and so on.&quot;</p><p>Lee pointed to a cultural advantage: Chinese technology companies have spent the past decade obsessively optimizing for user engagement and product-market fit in brutally competitive markets. &quot;The Chinese giants really work tenaciously, and they have mastered the art of figuring out product market fit,&quot; he said. &quot;Now they have to add technology to it. So that is inevitably going to happen.&quot;</p><p>This assessment aligns with recent industry observations. ByteDance&#x27;s <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/en/\"><u>TikTok</u></a> became the world&#x27;s most downloaded app through sophisticated AI-driven content recommendation, and Chinese companies have pioneered AI-powered features in areas like live-streaming commerce and short-form video that Western companies later copied.</p><p>Lee also noted that China has already deployed AI more widely in certain domains. &quot;There are a lot of areas where China has also done a great job, such as using computer vision, speech recognition, and translation more widely,&quot; he said.</p><h2><b>The surprising open-source shift that has Chinese models beating Meta&#x27;s Llama</b></h2><p>Perhaps Lee&#x27;s most striking data point concerned <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/why-open-source-ai-became-an-american-national-priority\"><u>open-source AI development</u></a> — an area where China appears to have seized leadership from American companies in a remarkably short time.</p><p>&quot;The 10 highest rated open source [models] are from China,&quot; Lee said. &quot;These companies have now eclipsed Meta&#x27;s Llama, which used to be number one.&quot;</p><p>This represents a significant shift. Meta&#x27;s <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/metas-answer-to-deepseek-is-here-llama-4-launches-with-long-context-scout-and-maverick-models-and-2t-parameter-behemoth-on-the-way\"><u>Llama models</u></a> were widely viewed as the gold standard for open-source large language models as recently as early 2024. But Chinese companies — including Lee&#x27;s own firm, <a href=\"http://01.ai\"><u>01.AI</u></a>, along with <a href=\"https://www.alibaba.com/\"><u>Alibaba</u></a>, <a href=\"https://www.baidu.com/\"><u>Baidu</u></a>, and others — have released a flood of open-source models that, according to various benchmarks, now outperform their American counterparts.</p><p>The open-source question has become a flashpoint in AI development. Lee made an extensive case for why open-source models will prove essential to the technology&#x27;s future, even as closed models from companies like OpenAI command higher prices and, often, superior performance.</p><p>&quot;I think open source has a number of major advantages,&quot; Lee argued. With open-source models, &quot;you can examine it, tune it, improve it. It&#x27;s yours, and it&#x27;s free, and it&#x27;s important for building if you want to build an application or tune the model to do something specific.&quot;</p><p>He drew an analogy to operating systems: &quot;People who work in operating systems loved Linux, and that&#x27;s why its adoption went through the roof. And I think in the future, open source will also allow people to tune a sovereign model for a country, make it work better for a particular language.&quot;</p><p>Still, Lee predicted both approaches will coexist. &quot;I don&#x27;t think open source models will win,&quot; he said. &quot;I think just like we have Apple, which is closed, but provides a somewhat better experience than Android... I think we&#x27;re going to see more apps using open-source models, more engineers wanting to build open-source models, but I think more money will remain in the closed model.&quot;</p><h2><b>Why China&#x27;s manufacturing advantage makes the robotics race &#x27;not over, but&#x27; nearly decided</b></h2><p>On robotics, Lee&#x27;s message was blunt: the combination of China&#x27;s manufacturing prowess, lower costs, and aggressive investment has created an advantage that will be difficult for American companies to overcome.</p><p>When asked directly whether the robotics race was already over with China victorious, Lee hedged only slightly. &quot;It&#x27;s not over, but I think the U.S. is still capable of coming up with the best robotic research ideas,&quot; he said. &quot;But the VCs in the U.S. don&#x27;t fund robotics the way the VCs do in China.&quot;</p><p>The challenge is structural. Building robots requires not just software and AI, but hardware manufacturing at scale — precisely the kind of integrated supply chain and low-cost production that China has spent decades perfecting. While American labs at universities and companies like <a href=\"https://bostondynamics.com/\"><u>Boston Dynamics</u></a> continue to produce impressive research prototypes, turning those prototypes into affordable commercial products requires the manufacturing ecosystem that China possesses.</p><p>Companies like <a href=\"https://www.unitree.com/\"><u>Unitree</u></a> have demonstrated this advantage concretely. The company&#x27;s humanoid robots and quadrupedal robots cost a fraction of their American-made equivalents while offering comparable or superior capabilities — a price-to-performance ratio that could prove decisive in commercial markets.</p><h2><b>What worries Lee most: not AGI, but the race itself</b></h2><p>Despite his generally measured tone about China&#x27;s AI development, Lee expressed concern about one area where he believes the global AI community faces real danger — not the far-future risk of superintelligent AI, but the near-term consequences of moving too fast.</p><p>When asked about <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/study-warns-of-security-risks-as-os-agents-gain-control-of-computers-and-phones\"><u>AGI risks</u></a>, Lee reframed the question. &quot;I&#x27;m less afraid of AI becoming self-aware and causing danger for humans in the short term,&quot; he said, &quot;but more worried about it being used by bad people to do terrible things, or by the AI race pushing people to work so hard, so fast and furious and move fast and break things that they build products that have problems and holes to be exploited.&quot;</p><p>He continued: &quot;I&#x27;m very worried about that. In fact, I think some terrible event will happen that will be a wake up call from this sort of problem.&quot;</p><p>Lee&#x27;s perspective carries unusual weight because of his unique vantage point spanning both Chinese and American AI development. Over a career spanning more than three decades, he has held senior positions at <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/\"><u>Apple</u></a>, <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/\"><u>Microsoft</u></a>, and <a href=\"https://www.google.com/?zx=1761178473681&amp;no_sw_cr=1\"><u>Google</u></a>, while also founding <a href=\"https://www.sinovationventures.com/\"><u>Sinovation Ventures</u></a>, which has invested in more than 400 companies across both countries. His AI company, <a href=\"http://01.ai\"><u>01.AI</u></a>, founded in 2023, has released several <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/01-ai\"><u>open-source models</u></a> that rank among the most capable in the world.</p><p>For American companies and policymakers, Lee&#x27;s analysis presents a complex strategic picture. The United States appears to have clear advantages in enterprise AI software, fundamental research, and computing infrastructure. But China is moving faster in consumer applications, manufacturing robotics at lower costs, and potentially pulling ahead in open-source model development.</p><p>The bifurcation suggests that rather than a single &quot;winner&quot; in AI, the world may be heading toward a technology landscape where different countries excel in different domains — with all the economic and geopolitical complications that implies.</p><p>As the <a href=\"https://tedai-sanfrancisco.ted.com/\"><u>TED AI conference</u></a> continued Wednesday, Lee&#x27;s assessment hung over subsequent discussions. His message seemed clear: the AI race is not one contest, but many — and the United States and China are each winning different races.</p><p>Standing in the conference hall afterward, one venture capitalist, who asked not to be named, summed up the mood in the room: &quot;We&#x27;re not competing with China anymore. We&#x27;re competing on parallel tracks.&quot; Whether those tracks eventually converge — or diverge into entirely separate technology ecosystems — may be the defining question of the next decade.</p>",
