# Fix Navigation Menu for Block Theme

Your site is using a WordPress block theme (Gutenberg). Navigation menus work differently in block themes.

## Option 1: Add Navigation Block via Site Editor (Recommended)

1. **Go to Site Editor:**
   - WordPress Admin → Appearance → Editor
   - Or: `https://mytribal.ai/wp-admin/site-editor.php`

2. **Edit Header Template:**
   - Click on "Templates" in the left sidebar
   - Find and click "Header" template
   - Click "Edit" button

3. **Add Navigation Block:**
   - Click the "+" button to add a block
   - Search for "Navigation" block
   - Click on "Navigation" to add it

4. **Configure Navigation:**
   - In the Navigation block settings (right sidebar):
     - Under "Menu", select your menu (the one you created with Services, Case Studies, etc.)
     - If menu doesn't appear, make sure it exists first (see below)

5. **Save:**
   - Click "Save" button (top right)

## Option 2: Create Menu First (If You Haven't)

If you haven't created the menu yet:

1. **Create Menu:**
   - Go to: Appearance → Menus
   - Click "create a new menu" if needed
   - Name it: "Main Menu" or "Primary Menu"
   - Add pages: Services, Case Studies, About Us, Contact
   - Click "Save Menu"

2. **Then follow Option 1 above to add it to header**

## Option 3: Use Appearance → Customize (Alternative)

Some block themes also support the Customizer:

1. Go to: Appearance → Customize
2. Look for "Navigation" or "Menus" section
3. Select your menu
4. Choose menu location: "Primary" or "Header"
5. Click "Publish"

## Option 4: Check Theme Documentation

Your theme might have specific instructions. Common block themes:
- Twenty Twenty-Three
- Twenty Twenty-Four
- Other block-based themes

Check your theme's documentation for navigation setup.

## Quick Check: What Theme Are You Using?

1. Go to: Appearance → Themes
2. Note the active theme name
3. This will help determine the exact steps

## Verify Menu Was Created

1. Go to: Appearance → Menus
2. Select your menu from dropdown
3. Verify you see: Services, Case Studies, About Us, Contact
4. If not, add them following the earlier instructions

## Still Not Working?

The navigation might need to be added to the header template part. This requires:
- Going to Site Editor
- Editing the Header template
- Adding a Navigation block
- Selecting your menu

Let me know what theme you're using and I can provide more specific instructions!
